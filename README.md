####Link: [Booklist](https://rubybooklist.herokuapp.com/)
***

This is a CRUD web application built with Ruby on Rails that allows users to create a booklist. Users can add, update and delete books from their booklists. To access their booklist, users must sign up and login with their credentials.  Once logged in, users can search the database for existing books and add them to their lists. Users can sort their lists and results alphabetically. 


I started this project to learn Ruby on Rails. This project is in progress and I intend to add more functionality in the near future, including using an external book API to provide users with a greater number of book titles.
